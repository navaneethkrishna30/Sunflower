# Sunflower

## Introduction

Our idea is to align solar panels towards the sun throughout the day to maximize the power output.

The core idea stems from the natural behaviour of Sunflowers which always face the sun(hence the name). Our goal is to mimic that behaviour. We are using pvlib package in python for calculating the angles.

pvlib python is a community developed toolbox that provides a set of functions and classes for simulating the performance of photovoltaic energy systems and accomplishing related tasks.
